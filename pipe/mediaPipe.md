# about

The MediaPipe Tasks framework by Google is related to TensorFlow Lite and LiteRT in that it offers pre-built, on-device machine learning solutions for various applications, including vision, audio, and natural language tasks. It integrates with TensorFlow Lite (now LiteRT) to run machine learning models efficiently on mobile and embedded devices. MediaPipe Tasks provide easy-to-use APIs and support for running custom TensorFlow Lite models, making it a complementary framework for deploying AI solutions on edge devices with minimal development effort.
