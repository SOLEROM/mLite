# interpreter

make predictions based on input data achieved with the LiteRT interpreter, which uses a static graph ordering and a custom (less-dynamic) memory allocator to ensure minimal load, initialization, and execution latency.


On Linux platforms, you can run inferences using LiteRT APIs available in C++.

Loading and running a LiteRT model involves the following steps:
```
    Loading the model into memory.
    Building an Interpreter based on an existing model.
    Setting input tensor values.
    Invoking inferences.
    Outputting tensor values.
```
